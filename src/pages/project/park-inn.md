This project was made in 2022 while I was studying Software Engineering at Universidad de Sevilla. The goal
of this was learning how to work in a considerable group (11 people) and making use of soft skills and the whole things learned during those years. The project lasted 3 months.

We develop this using SCRUM methodology for the organization, making daily meetings, retrospective and sprints. Furthermore for the version control of the code GitHub was our preference.

Talking about the technology stack we selected ReactJS, SpringBoot, MySQL, Microsoft Azure, Codacy and GitHub Actions. We wanted to learn all about projects development, from the simpliest to aproach a realistic enviroment of work, that is the reason why we include continous integration and quality code control.

In a nutshell PARK-INN allows you to find a place where park your car in crowed cities on an easy, cheap and secure way. Depends on your location it recommends you private parkings. Also you can rento your own parking for earning some money.
